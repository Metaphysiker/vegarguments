  <h3>
    Guidelines
  </h3>
  Let's face it. Most people don't give a shit about animal suffering.
  If we want them to care about animal suffering, we have to give them good reasons.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are also different kinds of people and therefore different kinds of reasons or arguments that appeal to them.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I don't think that any kind of reason that may motivate some people to care about animal suffering is automatically a good one.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, arguments like "Killing animals will have a bad effect on your Karma!"
    or "According to the indians, cows are holy! So don't eat them!"
    may motivate some people to care about animals, but I'm not very comfortable with these kinds of arguments.
  </p>
  <p>
    For one thing, these arguments are not about animals but rather about something different, namely religion or self-interest.
    But I think that we should treat animals well, not because some of them are holy or because it is in our own interest to do so, but because <b>suffering is bad</b> and <b>we shouldn't cause suffering unnecessarily</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    That being said, I think we should avoid making arguments that have the potential to "backfire".
    For instance, the "Cows are holy"-example seems to imply that some animals aren't holy.
    And the undesirable effect will be that some people may care about cows but not about other animals.
